Usage: to run this programthere are two options
1. Compile it, and then run it
	$go build sender.go
	and then to run it
	$./sender data_file source_ip destination_ip source_port destination_port datagram_filename
2. Run in the go playground
	go run sender.go data_file source_ip destination_ip source_port destination_port datagram_filename
In both cases, the input arguments are the same. The data_file is the file that contains the data you wish to transmit. The source and destination IP must be of the format X.X.X.X where every value is below 256.
an example run:

$./sender test.txt 192.168.1.123 173.24.24.155 1337 2077 datagram
$./Receiver 192.168.1.123 173.24.24.155 datagram

The above run will give the result of a correct checksum. In my experience, the Receiver does not work for exceptionally large inputs. My program still outputs "correctly" although much too larg for real world communication.
