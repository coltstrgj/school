Usage: to run these programs there are two options 
1. Compile it, and then run it
	$go build rcmd.go
	and then to run it like a normal program (./rcmd ...ARGS)
2. Run in the go playground
	go run rcmd.go ...ARGS

-------------------------Program Arguments-----------------------------------------------------------------
Run any program with no input arguments to get a usage message that will explain all the paramaters that it needs

Example runs (you will need a file named imagine.jpg in $PWD/tmp)
to run the server:
$go run rcmd.go server 40401
--This program does require user input (instructions provided in console) when receiving a file

to run the client:
$go run rcmd.go client  127.0.0.1:40401 ls "-A -l" 5 2
 which will run "ls" on the server with the argument"-A" and argument "-l" 5 times with a two second delay between runs
