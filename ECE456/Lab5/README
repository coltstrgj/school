Usage: to run these programs there are two options 
1. Compile it, and then run it
	$go build TCP_FT.go
	and then to run it like a normal program (./TCP_FT ...ARGS)
2. Run in the go playground
	go run TCP_FT.go ...ARGS

-------------------------Program Arguments-----------------------------------------------------------------
Run any program with no input arguments to get a usage message that will explain all the paramaters that it needs

Example runs (you will need a file named imagine.jpg in $PWD/tmp)
to run the server:
$go run TCP_FT server 40401
--This program does require user input (instructions provided in console) when receiving a file

to run the client:
$go run TCP_FT client 127.0.0.1 40401 tmp/imagine.jpg

These two programs really should be run in different terminals to get the full effect of the program(no output from one obfuscating instructions for user from another)
the above will give a file called imagine.jpg in $PWD
