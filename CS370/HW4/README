ProducerConsumer
    This file will be what you run(java ProducerConsumer)
    It sets up the treads and such
BoundedBuffer
    This is the buffer. It keeps track of when to wait and notify 
    consumer/Producer
Producer
    Produces a set of 1 million random numbers and keeps a cumulative value
    adds these to the small buffer making sure to not override any thing
    that has not been read yet
consumer
    reads the set of 1 million numbers and also keeps track. It is careful
    to not read anything twice (and get ahead of Producer) thanks to 
    BoundedBuffer
